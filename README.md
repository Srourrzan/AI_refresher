# AI Refresher with PyTorch

A focused repository for learning Artificial Intelligence fundamentals with PyTorch, covering Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

## 📚 Overview

This refresher covers practical implementations and in-depth explanations of:

- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** - Fundamentals, backpropagation, and training strategies
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** - Image processing, feature extraction, and classification
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** - Text detection and recognition using deep learning

## 🛠️ Environment

This repository is designed to be used with **Google Colab** for easy access to GPU/TPU resources without local installation.

## 📖 Usage

Each section contains:
- **Theory explanations** with key concepts
- **Code examples** demonstrating implementations
- **Exercises** for hands-on practice
- **Jupyter notebooks** for interactive exploration

To use with Google Colab:

```python
# Clone the repository in Colab
!git clone https://github.com/Srourrzan/AI_refresher.git

# Install any additional dependencies (if needed)
!pip install torch torchvision
```

Then open the notebooks in Colab for interactive learning with GPU acceleration.
